# Reflection on Portfolio Development

Developing my portfolio website as part of this internship has been an excellent opportunity to apply modern front-end practices while learning to prioritize accessibility and responsiveness. From the beginning, I focused on semantic HTML5 structure, ensuring that every section of the portfolio followed logical, descriptive tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. This approach not only improved readability but also supported accessibility tools like screen readers.

CSS was implemented with a mobile-first strategy, using Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure layouts adapt smoothly to devices ranging from smartphones to desktops. I paid particular attention to WCAG 2.2 guidelines, using color contrast tools to guarantee AA compliance. This made the site more inclusive and user-friendly.

Adding JavaScript interactivity, such as a dark mode toggle and simple form validation, enhanced user engagement while remaining lightweight and efficient. All scripts were documented and implemented with progressive enhancement in mind, meaning that even if JavaScript is disabled, the core content remains accessible.

Version control through GitHub was crucial to my workflow. Clear commit messages and structured branching allowed me to track progress professionally, while GitHub Pages enabled seamless deployment of the live site. Using Chrome DevTools and the WAVE Accessibility Tool, I was able to iteratively test and improve both performance and accessibility.

Overall, this project reinforced the importance of combining technical precision with ethical responsibility. My portfolio not only represents my technical growth but also reflects my commitment to developing web applications that are inclusive, maintainable, and aligned with industry best practices.
